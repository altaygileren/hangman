### Stack: React, Random Word Generator API, Local Storage

*The user is prompted to input their name, 
*Enter the game and select letters until they solve the word. 
*If they can't solve the word in the alloted amounts of tries(the amount of letters in the word is the same amount of tries they get.. so if the word is 10 letters long they get 10 tries) then the word gets inputted in the wrong words list. 
*If solved, it goes into the solved words list. 
*All words and their name are stored to their local storage so no database is needed.
